Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

we have to return index of strings where the pattern anagram starts.

brute force - we make two nested loops starting from 0th index, we move and check. 

optimal - sliding window
