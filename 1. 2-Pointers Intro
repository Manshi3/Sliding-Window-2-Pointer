2-Pointers

- You may come up with two pointers/ sliding window technique at the very beginning thought, which is not right after you have tried. Here is the general summary to expalin why 
we can not apply two pointers to solve this problem.

- Let go through the process of explanation by introducing what kind of problem can be solved with two pointers, such that if this problem doesn't match the criteria, it cannot 
be solved with two pointers.

- A problem can be solved by two pointers when two pointers come into place to help us reduce the total cases we need to consider, such that the corresponding time complexity 
will reduce too.
